/// Algorithms to use when painting on the canvas.

/// When drawing a shape or image onto a canvas, different algorithms can be

///
/// Each algorithm has two inputs, the _source_, which is the image being drawn,
/// and the _destination_, which is the image into which the source image is
/// being composited. The destination is often thought of as the _background_.
/// The source and destination both have four color channels, the red, green,
/// blue, and alpha channels. These are typically represented as numbers in the
/// range 0.0 to 1.0. The output of the algorithm also has these same four
/// channels, with values computed from the source and destination.
///
/// The documentation of each value below describes how the algorithm works. In
/// each case, an image shows the output of blending a source image with a
/// destination image. In the images below, the destination is represented by an
/// image with horizontal lines and an opaque landscape photograph, and the
/// source is represented by an image with vertical lines (the same lines but
/// rotated) and a bird clip-art image. The [src] mode shows only the source
/// image, and the [dst] mode shows only the destination image. In the
/// documentation below, the transparency is illustrated by a checkerboard
/// pattern. The [clear] mode drops both the source and destination, resulting
/// in an output that is entirely transparent (illustrated by a solid
/// checkerboard pattern).
///
/// The horizontal and vertical bars in these images show the red, green, and
/// blue channels with varying opacity levels, then all three color channels
/// together with those same varying opacity levels, then all three color
/// channels set to zero with those varying opacity levels, then two bars
/// showing a red/green/blue repeating gradient, the first with full opacity and
/// the second with partial opacity, and finally a bar with the three color
/// channels set to zero but the opacity varying in a repeating gradient.
///
/// ## Application to the [Canvas] API
///
/// When using [Canvas.saveLayer] and [Canvas.restore], the blend mode of the
/// [Paint] given to the [Canvas.saveLayer] will be applied when
/// [Canvas.restore] is called. Each call to [Canvas.saveLayer] introduces a new
/// layer onto which shapes and images are painted; when [Canvas.restore] is
/// called, that layer is then composited onto the parent layer, with the source
/// being the most-recently-drawn shapes and images, and the destination being
/// the parent layer. (For the first [Canvas.saveLayer] call, the parent layer
/// is the canvas itself.)
