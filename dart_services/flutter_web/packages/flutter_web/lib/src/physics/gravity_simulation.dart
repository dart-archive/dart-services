/// A simulation that applies a constant accelerating force.
///
/// Models a particle that follows Newton's second law of motion. The simulation
/// ends when the position reaches a defined point.
///
/// ## Sample code
///
/// This method triggers an [AnimationController] (a previously constructed
/// `_controller` field) to simulate a fall of 300 pixels.
///
/// ```dart
/// void _startFall() {
///   _controller.animateWith(new GravitySimulation(
///     10.0, // acceleration, pixels per second per second
///     0.0, // starting position, pixels
///     300.0, // ending position, pixels
///     0.0, // starting velocity, pixels per second
///   ));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This [AnimationController] could be used with an [AnimatedBuilder] to
/// animate the position of a child as if it was falling.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Curves.bounceOut], a [Curve] that has a similar aesthetics but includes
///    a bouncing effect.

  /// respectively: an acceleration that is to be applied continually over time;
  /// an initial position relative to an origin; the magnitude of the distance
  /// from that origin beyond which (in either direction) to consider the
  /// simulation to be "done", which must be positive; and an initial velocity.
  ///
  /// The initial position and maximum distance are measured in arbitrary length
  /// units L from an arbitrary origin. The units will match those used for [x].
  ///
  /// The time unit T used for the arguments to [x], [dx], and [isDone],
  /// combined with the aforementioned length unit, together determine the units
  /// that must be used for the velocity and acceleration arguments: L/T and
