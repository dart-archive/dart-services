/// A binding for the gesture subsystem.
///
/// ## Lifecycle of pointer events and the gesture arena
///
/// ### [PointerDownEvent]
///
/// When a [PointerDownEvent] is received by the [GestureBinding] (from
/// [Window.onPointerDataPacket], as interpreted by the
/// [PointerEventConverter]), a [hitTest] is performed to determine which
/// [HitTestTarget] nodes are affected. (Other bindings are expected to
/// implement [hitTest] to defer to [HitTestable] objects. For example, the
/// rendering layer defers to the [RenderView] and the rest of the render object
/// hierarchy.)
///
/// The affected nodes then are given the event to handle ([dispatchEvent] calls
/// [HitTestTarget.handleEvent] for each affected node). If any have relevant
/// [GestureRecognizer]s, they provide the event to them using
/// [GestureRecognizer.addPointer]. This typically causes the recognizer to
/// register with the [PointerRouter] to receive notifications regarding the
/// pointer in question.
///
/// Once the hit test and dispatching logic is complete, the event is then
/// passed to the aforementioned [PointerRouter], which passes it to any objects
/// that have registered interest in that event.
///
/// Finally, the [gestureArena] is closed for the given pointer
/// ([GestureArenaManager.close]), which begins the process of selecting a
/// gesture to win that pointer.
///
/// ### Other events
///
/// A pointer that is [PointerEvent.down] may send further events, such as
/// [PointerMoveEvent], [PointerUpEvent], or [PointerCancelEvent]. These are
/// sent to the same [HitTestTarget] nodes as were found when the down event was
/// received (even if they have since been disposed; it is the responsibility of
/// those objects to be aware of that possibility).
///
/// Then, the events are routed to any still-registered entrants in the
/// [PointerRouter]'s table for that pointer.
///
/// When a [PointerUpEvent] is received, the [GestureArenaManager.sweep] method
/// is invoked to force the gesture arena logic to terminate if necessary.
