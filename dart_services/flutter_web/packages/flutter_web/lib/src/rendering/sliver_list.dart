/// axis.
///
/// Each child is forced to have the [SliverConstraints.crossAxisExtent] in the
/// cross axis but determines its own main axis extent.
///
/// [RenderSliverList] determines its scroll offset by "dead reckoning" because
/// children outside the visible part of the sliver are not materialized, which
/// means [RenderSliverList] cannot learn their main axis extent. Instead, newly
/// materialized children are placed adjacent to existing children. If this dead
/// reckoning results in a logical inconsistency (e.g., attempting to place the
/// zeroth child at a scroll offset other than zero), the [RenderSliverList]
/// generates a [SliverGeometry.scrollOffsetCorrection] to restore consistency.
///
/// If the children have a fixed extent in the main axis, consider using
/// [RenderSliverFixedExtentList] rather than [RenderSliverList] because
/// [RenderSliverFixedExtentList] does not need to perform layout on its
/// children to obtain their extent in the main axis and is therefore more
/// efficient.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [RenderSliverFixedExtentList], which is more efficient for children with
///    the same extent in the main axis.
///  * [RenderSliverGrid], which places its children in arbitrary positions.
