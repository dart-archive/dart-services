/// A [ListTile] with a [Checkbox]. In other words, a checkbox with a label.
///
/// The entire list tile is interactive: tapping anywhere in the tile toggles
/// the checkbox.
///
/// The [value], [onChanged], and [activeColor] properties of this widget are
/// identical to the similarly-named properties on the [Checkbox] widget.
///
/// The [title], [subtitle], [isThreeLine], and [dense] properties are like
/// those of the same name on [ListTile].
///
/// The [selected] property on this widget is similar to the [ListTile.selected]
/// property, but the color used is that described by [activeColor], if any,
/// defaulting to the accent color of the current [Theme]. No effort is made to
/// coordinate the [selected] state and the [value] state; to have the list tile
/// appear selected when the checkbox is checked, pass the same value to both.
///
/// The checkbox is shown on the right by default in left-to-right languages
/// (i.e. the trailing edge). This can be changed using [controlAffinity]. The
/// [secondary] widget is placed on the opposite side. This maps to the
/// [ListTile.leading] and [ListTile.trailing] properties of [ListTile].
///
/// To show the [CheckboxListTile] as disabled, pass null as the [onChanged]
/// callback.
///
/// ## Sample code
///
/// This widget shows a checkbox that, when checked, slows down all animations
/// (including the animation of the checkbox itself getting checked!).
///
/// ```dart
/// CheckboxListTile(
///   title: const Text('Animate Slowly'),
///   value: timeDilation != 1.0,
///   onChanged: (bool value) {
///     setState(() { timeDilation = value ? 20.0 : 1.0; });
///   },
///   secondary: const Icon(Icons.hourglass_empty),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// This sample requires that you also import 'package:flutter/scheduler.dart',
/// so that you can reference [timeDilation].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [ListTileTheme], which can be used to affect the style of list tiles,
///    including checkbox list tiles.
///  * [RadioListTile], a similar widget for radio buttons.
///  * [SwitchListTile], a similar widget for switches.
///  * [ListTile] and [Checkbox], the widgets from which this widget is made.
class CheckboxListTile extends StatelessWidget {
  /// Creates a combination of a list tile and a checkbox.
  ///
  /// The checkbox tile itself does not maintain any state. Instead, when the
  /// state of the checkbox changes, the widget calls the [onChanged] callback.
  /// Most widgets that use a checkbox will listen for the [onChanged] callback
  /// and rebuild the checkbox tile with a new [value] to update the visual
  /// appearance of the checkbox.
  ///
  /// The following arguments are required:
  ///
  /// * [value], which determines whether the checkbox is checked, and must not
  ///   be null.
  ///
  /// * [onChanged], which is called when the value of the checkbox should
  ///   change. It can be set to null to disable the checkbox.
