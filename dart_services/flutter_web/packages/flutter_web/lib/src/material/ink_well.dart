///
/// For a variant of this widget that is specialized for rectangular areas that
/// always clip splashes, see [InkWell].
///
/// An [InkResponse] widget does two things when responding to a tap:
///
///  * It starts to animate a _highlight_. The shape of the highlight is
///    determined by [highlightShape]. If it is a [BoxShape.circle], the
///    default, then the highlight is a circle of fixed size centered in the
///    [InkResponse]. If it is [BoxShape.rectangle], then the highlight is a box
///    the size of the [InkResponse] itself, unless [getRectCallback] is
///    provided, in which case that callback defines the rectangle. The color of
///    the highlight is set by [highlightColor].
///
///  * Simultaneously, it starts to animate a _splash_. This is a growing circle
///    initially centered on the tap location. If this is a [containedInkWell],
///    the splash grows to the [radius] while remaining centered at the tap
///    location. Otherwise, the splash migrates to the center of the box as it
///    grows.
///
/// The following two diagrams show how [InkResponse] looks when tapped if the
/// [highlightShape] is [BoxShape.circle] (the default) and [containedInkWell]
/// is false (also the default).
///
/// The first diagram shows how it looks if the [InkResponse] is relatively
/// large:
///
/// ![The highlight is a disc centered in the box, smaller than the child widget.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/ink_response_large.png)
///
/// The second diagram shows how it looks if the [InkResponse] is small:
///
/// ![The highlight is a disc overflowing the box, centered on the child.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/ink_response_small.png)
///
/// The main thing to notice from these diagrams is that the splashes happily
/// exceed the bounds of the widget (because [containedInkWell] is false).
///
/// The following diagram shows the effect when the [InkResponse] has a
/// [highlightShape] of [BoxShape.rectangle] with [containedInkWell] set to
/// true. These are the values used by [InkWell].
///
/// ![The highlight is a rectangle the size of the box.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/ink_well.png)
///
/// The [InkResponse] widget must have a [Material] widget as an ancestor. The
/// [Material] widget is where the ink reactions are actually painted. This
/// matches the material design premise wherein the [Material] is what is
/// actually reacting to touches by spreading ink.
///
/// If a Widget uses this class directly, it should include the following line
/// at the top of its build function to call [debugCheckHasMaterial]:
///
/// ```dart
/// assert(debugCheckHasMaterial(context));
/// ```
///
/// ## Troubleshooting
///
/// ### The ink splashes aren't visible!
///
/// If there is an opaque graphic, e.g. painted using a [Container], [Image], or
/// [DecoratedBox], between the [Material] widget and the [InkResponse] widget,
/// then the splash won't be visible because it will be under the opaque graphic.
/// This is because ink splashes draw on the underlying [Material] itself, as
/// if the ink was spreading inside the material.
///
/// The [Ink] widget can be used as a replacement for [Image], [Container], or
/// [DecoratedBox] to ensure that the image or decoration also paints in the
/// [Material] itself, below the ink.
///
/// If this is not possible for some reason, e.g. because you are using an
/// opaque [CustomPaint] widget, alternatively consider using a second
/// [Material] above the opaque widget but below the [InkResponse] (as an
/// ancestor to the ink response). The [MaterialType.transparency] material
/// kind can be used for this purpose.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [GestureDetector], for listening for gestures without ink splashes.
///  * [RaisedButton] and [FlatButton], two kinds of buttons in material design.
///  * [IconButton], which combines [InkResponse] with an [Icon].

/// A rectangular area of a [Material] that responds to touch.
///
/// For a variant of this widget that does not clip splashes, see [InkResponse].
///
/// The following diagram shows how an [InkWell] looks when tapped, when using
/// default values.
///
/// ![The highlight is a rectangle the size of the box.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/ink_well.png)
///
/// The [InkWell] widget must have a [Material] widget as an ancestor. The
/// [Material] widget is where the ink reactions are actually painted. This
/// matches the material design premise wherein the [Material] is what is
/// actually reacting to touches by spreading ink.
///
/// If a Widget uses this class directly, it should include the following line
/// at the top of its build function to call [debugCheckHasMaterial]:
///
/// ```dart
/// assert(debugCheckHasMaterial(context));
/// ```
///
/// ## Troubleshooting
///
/// ### The ink splashes aren't visible!
///
/// If there is an opaque graphic, e.g. painted using a [Container], [Image], or
/// [DecoratedBox], between the [Material] widget and the [InkWell] widget, then
/// the splash won't be visible because it will be under the opaque graphic.
/// This is because ink splashes draw on the underlying [Material] itself, as
/// if the ink was spreading inside the material.
///
/// The [Ink] widget can be used as a replacement for [Image], [Container], or
/// [DecoratedBox] to ensure that the image or decoration also paints in the
/// [Material] itself, below the ink.
///
/// If this is not possible for some reason, e.g. because you are using an
/// opaque [CustomPaint] widget, alternatively consider using a second
/// [Material] above the opaque widget but below the [InkWell] (as an
/// ancestor to the ink well). The [MaterialType.transparency] material
/// kind can be used for this purpose.
///
/// ### The ink splashes don't track the size of an animated container
/// If the size of an InkWell's [Material] ancestor changes while the InkWell's
/// splashes are expanding, you may notice that the splashes aren't clipped
/// correctly. This can't be avoided.
///
/// An example of this situation is as follows:
///
/// {@tool snippet --template=stateful_widget_scaffold}
///
/// Tap the container to cause it to grow. Then, tap it again and hold before
/// the widget reaches its maximum size to observe the clipped ink splash.
///
/// ```dart
/// double sideLength = 50;
///
/// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///   return Center(
///     child: AnimatedContainer(
///       height: sideLength,
///       width: sideLength,
///       duration: Duration(seconds: 2),
///       curve: Curves.easeIn,
///       child: Material(
///         color: Colors.yellow,
///         child: InkWell(
///           onTap: () {
///             setState(() {
///               sideLength == 50 ? sideLength = 100 : sideLength = 50;
///             });
///           },
///         ),
///       ),
///     ),
///   );
/// }
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// An InkWell's splashes will not properly update to conform to changes if the
/// size of its underlying [Material], where the splashes are rendered, changes
/// during animation. You should avoid using InkWells within [Material] widgets
/// that are changing size.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [GestureDetector], for listening for gestures without ink splashes.
///  * [RaisedButton] and [FlatButton], two kinds of buttons in material design.
///  * [InkResponse], a variant of [InkWell] that doesn't force a rectangular
///    shape on the ink reaction.
