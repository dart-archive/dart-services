/// A modal route that replaces the entire screen with a platform-adaptive
/// transition.
///
/// For Android, the entrance transition for the page slides the page upwards
/// and fades it in. The exit transition is the same, but in reverse.
///
/// The transition is adaptive to the platform and on iOS, the page slides in
/// from the right and exits in reverse. The page also shifts to the left in
/// parallax when another page enters to cover it. (These directions are flipped
/// in environments with a right-to-left reading direction.)
///
/// By default, when a modal route is replaced by another, the previous route
/// remains in memory. To free all the resources when this is not necessary, set
/// [maintainState] to false.
///
/// The `fullscreenDialog` property specifies whether the incoming page is a
/// fullscreen modal dialog. On iOS, those pages animate from the bottom to the
/// top rather than horizontally.
///
/// The type `T` specifies the return type of the route which can be supplied as
/// the route is popped from the stack via [Navigator.pop] by providing the
/// optional `result` argument.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [PageTransitionsTheme], which defines the default page transitions used
///    by [MaterialPageRoute.buildTransitions].
