/// This is useful for improving the accessibility of text in different states
/// of a component. For example, in a [FlatButton] with blue text, the text will
/// become more difficult to read when the button is hovered, focused, or pressed,
/// because the contrast ratio between the button and the text will decrease. To
/// solve this, you can use [MaterialStateColor] to make the text darker when the
/// [FlatButton] is hovered, focused, or pressed.
///
/// To use a [MaterialStateColor], you can either:
///   1. Create a subclass of [MaterialStateColor] and implement the abstract `resolve` method.
///   2. Use [MaterialStateColor.resolveWith] and pass in a callback that
///      will be used to resolve the color in the given states.
///
/// This should only be used as parameters when they are documented to take
/// [MaterialStateColor], otherwise only the default state will be used.
///

/// This example shows how you could pass a `MaterialStateColor` to `FlatButton.textColor`.
/// Here, the text color will be `Colors.blue[900]` when the button is being
/// pressed, hovered, or focused. Otherwise, the text color will be `Colors.blue[600]`.
