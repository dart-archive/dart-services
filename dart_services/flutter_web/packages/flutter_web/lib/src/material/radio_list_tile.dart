/// A [ListTile] with a [Radio]. In other words, a radio button with a label.
///
/// The entire list tile is interactive: tapping anywhere in the tile selects
/// the radio button.
///
/// The [value], [groupValue], [onChanged], and [activeColor] properties of this
/// widget are identical to the similarly-named properties on the [Radio]
/// widget. The type parameter `T` serves the same purpose as that of the
/// [Radio] class' type parameter.
///
/// The [title], [subtitle], [isThreeLine], and [dense] properties are like
/// those of the same name on [ListTile].
///
/// The [selected] property on this widget is similar to the [ListTile.selected]
/// property, but the color used is that described by [activeColor], if any,
/// defaulting to the accent color of the current [Theme]. No effort is made to
/// coordinate the [selected] state and the [checked] state; to have the list
/// tile appear selected when the radio button is the selected radio button, set
/// [selected] to true when [value] matches [groupValue].
///
/// The radio button is shown on the left by default in left-to-right languages
/// (i.e. the leading edge). This can be changed using [controlAffinity]. The
/// [secondary] widget is placed on the opposite side. This maps to the
/// [ListTile.leading] and [ListTile.trailing] properties of [ListTile].
///
/// To show the [RadioListTile] as disabled, pass null as the [onChanged]
/// callback.
///
/// ## Sample code
///
/// This widget shows a pair of radio buttons that control the `_character`
/// field. The field is of the type `SingingCharacter`, an enum.
///
/// ```dart
/// // At the top level:
/// enum SingingCharacter { lafayette, jefferson }
///
/// // In the State of a stateful widget:
/// SingingCharacter _character = SingingCharacter.lafayette;
///
/// // In the build function of that State:
/// Column(
///   children: <Widget>[
///     RadioListTile<SingingCharacter>(
///       title: const Text('Lafayette'),
///       value: SingingCharacter.lafayette,
///       groupValue: _character,
///       onChanged: (SingingCharacter value) { setState(() { _character = value; }); },
///     ),
///     RadioListTile<SingingCharacter>(
///       title: const Text('Thomas Jefferson'),
///       value: SingingCharacter.jefferson,
///       groupValue: _character,
///       onChanged: (SingingCharacter value) { setState(() { _character = value; }); },
///     ),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [ListTileTheme], which can be used to affect the style of list tiles,
///    including radio list tiles.
///  * [CheckboxListTile], a similar widget for checkboxes.
///  * [SwitchListTile], a similar widget for switches.
///  * [ListTile] and [Radio], the widgets from which this widget is made.

  /// widgets that use a radio button will listen for the [onChanged] callback
  /// and rebuild the radio tile with a new [groupValue] to update the visual
  /// appearance of the radio button.
  ///
  /// The following arguments are required:
  ///
  /// * [value] and [groupValue] together determine whether the radio button is
  ///   selected.
  /// * [onChanged] is called when the user selects this radio button.
