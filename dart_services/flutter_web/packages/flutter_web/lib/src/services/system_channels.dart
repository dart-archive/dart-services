  ///  * `Clipboard.setData`: Places the data from the `text` entry of the

  ///    [Clipboard.setData].
  ///
  ///  * `Clipboard.getData`: Returns the data that has the format specified in
  ///    the argument, a [String], from the system clipboard. The only format
  ///    currently supported is `text/plain` ([Clipboard.kTextPlain]). The
  ///    result is a [Map] with a single key, `text`. See [Clipboard.getData].
  ///
  ///  * `HapticFeedback.vibrate`: Triggers a system-default haptic response.
  ///    See [HapticFeedback.vibrate].
  ///
  ///  * `SystemSound.play`: Triggers a system audio effect. The argument must
  ///    be a [String] describing the desired effect; currently only `click` is
  ///    supported. See [SystemSound.play].
  ///
  ///  * `SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations`: Informs the operating system
  ///    of the desired orientation of the display. The argument is a [List] of
  ///    values which are string representations of values of the
  ///    [DeviceOrientation] enum. See [SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations].
  ///
  ///  * `SystemChrome.setApplicationSwitcherDescription`: Informs the operating
  ///    system of the desired label and color to be used to describe the
  ///    application in any system-level application lists (e.g. application
  ///    switchers). The argument is a [Map] with two keys, `label` giving a
  ///    [String] description, and `primaryColor` giving a 32 bit integer value
  ///    (the lower eight bits being the blue channel, the next eight bits being
  ///    the green channel, the next eight bits being the red channel, and the
  ///    high eight bits being set, as from [Color.value] for an opaque color).
  ///    The `primaryColor` can also be zero to indicate that the system default
  ///    should be used. See [SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations].
  ///
  ///  * `SystemChrome.setEnabledSystemUIOverlays`: Specifies the set of system
  ///    overlays to have visible when the application is running. The argument
  ///    is a [List] of values which are string representations of values of the
  ///    [SystemUiOverlay] enum. See [SystemChrome.setEnabledSystemUIOverlays].
  ///
  ///  * `SystemChrome.setSystemUIOverlayStyle`: Specifies whether system
  ///    overlays (e.g. the status bar on Android or iOS) should be `light` or
  ///    `dark`. The argument is one of those two strings. See
  ///    [SystemChrome.setSystemUIOverlayStyle].

  /// are represented by an integer. New Transactions are started by

  ///
  /// The following outgoing methods are defined for this channel (invoked using
  /// [OptionalMethodChannel.invokeMethod]):
  ///
  ///  * `TextInput.setClient`: Establishes a new transaction. The arguments is
  ///    a [List] whose first value is an integer representing a previously
  ///    unused transaction identifier, and the second is a [String] with a
  ///    JSON-encoded object with five keys, as obtained from
  ///    [TextInputConfiguration.toJSON]. This method must be invoked before any
  ///    others (except `TextInput.hide`). See [TextInput.attach].
  ///
  ///  * `TextInput.show`: Show the keyboard. See [TextInputConnection.show].
  ///
  ///  * `TextInput.setEditingState`: Update the value in the text editing
  ///    control. The argument is a [String] with a JSON-encoded object with
  ///    seven keys, as obtained from [TextEditingValue.toJSON]. See
  ///    [TextInputConnection.setEditingState].
  ///
  ///  * `TextInput.clearClient`: End the current transaction. The next method
  ///    called must be `TextInput.setClient` (or `TextInput.hide`). See
  ///    [TextInputConnection.close].
  ///
  ///  * `TextInput.hide`: Hide the keyboard. Unlike the other methods, this can

  /// using [MethodChannel.setMethodCallHandler]). In each case, the first argument
  /// is a transaction identifier. Calls for stale transactions should be ignored.

  ///    of the text control. The second argument is a [String] containing a
  ///    JSON-encoded object with seven keys, in the form expected by [new
  ///    TextEditingValue.fromJSON].
  ///
  ///  * `TextInputClient.performAction`: The user has triggered an action. The

  ///    of the values of the [TextInputAction] enum.
