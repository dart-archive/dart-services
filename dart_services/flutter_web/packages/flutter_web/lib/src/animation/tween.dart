/// A linear interpolation between a beginning and ending value.
///
/// [Tween] is useful if you want to interpolate across a range.
///
/// To use a [Tween] object with an animation, call the [Tween] object's
/// [animate] method and pass it the [Animation] object that you want to
/// modify.
///
/// You can chain [Tween] objects together using the [chain] method, so that a
/// single [Animation] object is configured by multiple [Tween] objects called
/// in succession. This is different than calling the [animate] method twice,
/// which results in two separate [Animation] objects, each configured with a
/// single [Tween].
///
/// {@tool sample}
///
/// Suppose `_controller` is an [AnimationController], and we want to create an
/// [Animation<Offset>] that is controlled by that controller, and save it in
/// `_animation`. Here are two possible ways of expressing this:
///
/// ```dart
/// _animation = _controller.drive(
///   Tween<Offset>(
///     begin: const Offset(100.0, 50.0),
///     end: const Offset(200.0, 300.0),
///   ),
/// );
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
/// {@tool sample}
///
/// ```dart
/// _animation = Tween<Offset>(
///   begin: const Offset(100.0, 50.0),
///   end: const Offset(200.0, 300.0),
/// ).animate(_controller);
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// In both cases, the `_animation` variable holds an object that, over the
/// lifetime of the `_controller`'s animation, returns a value
/// (`_animation.value`) that depicts a point along the line between the two
/// offsets above. If we used a [MaterialPointArcTween] instead of a
/// [Tween<Offset>] in the code above, the points would follow a pleasing curve
/// instead of a straight line, with no other changes necessary.
///
/// ## Performance optimizations
///
/// Tweens are mutable; specifically, their [begin] and [end] values can be
/// changed at runtime. An object created with [Animation.drive] using a [Tween]
/// will immediately honor changes to that underlying [Tween] (though the
/// listeners will only be triggered if the [Animation] is actively animating).
/// This can be used to change an animation on the fly without having to
/// recreate all the objects in the chain from the [AnimationController] to the
/// final [Tween].
///
/// If a [Tween]'s values are never changed, however, a further optimization can
/// be applied: the object can be stored in a `static final` variable, so that
/// the exact same instance is used whenever the [Tween] is needed. This is
/// preferable to creating an identical [Tween] afresh each time a [State.build]
/// method is called, for example.
///
/// ## Types with special considerations
///
/// Classes with [lerp] static methods typically have corresponding dedicated
/// [Tween] subclasses that call that method. For example, [ColorTween] uses
/// [Color.lerp] to implement the [ColorTween.lerp] method.
///
/// Types that define `+` and `-` operators to combine values (`T + T → T` and
/// `T - T → T`) and an `*` operator to scale by multiplying with a double (`T *
/// double → T`) can be directly used with `Tween<T>`.
///
/// This does not extend to any type with `+`, `-`, and `*` operators. In
/// particular, [int] does not satisfy this precise contract (`int * double`
/// actually returns [num], not [int]). There are therefore two specific classes
/// that can be used to interpolate integers:
///
///  * [IntTween], which is an approximation of a linear interpolation (using
///    [double.round]).
///  * [StepTween], which uses [double.floor] to ensure that the result is
///    never greater than it would be using if a `Tween<double>`.
///
/// The relevant operators on [Size] also don't fulfill this contract, so
/// [SizeTween] uses [Size.lerp].
///
/// In addition, some of the types that _do_ have suitable `+`, `-`, and `*`
/// operators still have dedicated [Tween] subclasses that perform the
/// interpolation in a more specialized manner. One such class is
/// [MaterialPointArcTween], which is mentioned above. The [AlignmentTween], and
/// [AlignmentGeometryTween], and [FractionalOffsetTween] are another group of
/// [Tween]s that use dedicated `lerp` methods instead of merely relying on the
/// operators (in particular, this allows them to handle null values in a more
/// useful manner).
class Tween<T extends dynamic> extends Animatable<T> {
