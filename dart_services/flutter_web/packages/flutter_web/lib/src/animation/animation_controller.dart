/// Configures how an [AnimationController] behaves when animations are disabled.
///
/// When [AccessibilityFeatures.disableAnimations] is true, the device is asking
/// Flutter to reduce or disable animations as much as possible. To honor this,
/// we reduce the duration and the corresponding number of frames for animations.
/// This enum is used to allow certain [AnimationController]s to opt out of this
/// behavior.
///
/// For example, the [AnimationController] which controls the physics simulation
/// for a scrollable list will have [AnimationBehavior.preserve] so that when
/// a user attempts to scroll it does not jump to the end/beginning too quickly.

  /// flashing rapidly on the screen if the widget does not take the
  /// [AccessibilityFeatures.disableAnimations] flag into account.
  preserve,
}

/// A controller for an animation.
///
/// This class lets you perform tasks such as:
///
/// * Play an animation [forward] or in [reverse], or [stop] an animation.
/// * Set the animation to a specific [value].
/// * Define the [upperBound] and [lowerBound] values of an animation.
/// * Create a [fling] animation effect using a physics simulation.
///
/// By default, an [AnimationController] linearly produces values that range
/// from 0.0 to 1.0, during a given duration. The animation controller generates
/// a new value whenever the device running your app is ready to display a new
/// frame (typically, this rate is around 60 values per second).
///
/// ## Ticker providers
///
/// An [AnimationController] needs a [TickerProvider], which is configured using
/// the `vsync` argument on the constructor.
///
/// The [TickerProvider] interface describes a factory for [Ticker] objects. A
/// [Ticker] is an object that knows how to register itself with the
/// [SchedulerBinding] and fires a callback every frame. The
/// [AnimationController] class uses a [Ticker] to step through the animation
/// that it controls.
///
/// If an [AnimationController] is being created from a [State], then the State
/// can use the [TickerProviderStateMixin] and [SingleTickerProviderStateMixin]
/// classes to implement the [TickerProvider] interface. The
/// [TickerProviderStateMixin] class always works for this purpose; the
/// [SingleTickerProviderStateMixin] is slightly more efficient in the case of
/// the class only ever needing one [Ticker] (e.g. if the class creates only a
/// single [AnimationController] during its entire lifetime).
///
/// The widget test framework [WidgetTester] object can be used as a ticker
/// provider in the context of tests. In other contexts, you will have to either
/// pass a [TickerProvider] from a higher level (e.g. indirectly from a [State]
/// that mixes in [TickerProviderStateMixin]), or create a custom
/// [TickerProvider] subclass.
///
/// ## Life cycle
///
/// An [AnimationController] should be [dispose]d when it is no longer needed.
/// This reduces the likelihood of leaks. When used with a [StatefulWidget], it
/// is common for an [AnimationController] to be created in the
/// [State.initState] method and then disposed in the [State.dispose] method.
///
/// ## Using [Future]s with [AnimationController]
///
/// The methods that start animations return a [TickerFuture] object which
/// completes when the animation completes successfully, and never throws an
/// error; if the animation is canceled, the future never completes. This object
/// also has a [TickerFuture.orCancel] property which returns a future that
/// completes when the animation completes successfully, and completes with an
/// error when the animation is aborted.
///
/// This can be used to write code such as the `fadeOutAndUpdateState` method
/// below.
///
/// {@tool sample}
///
/// Here is a stateful [Foo] widget. Its [State] uses the
/// [SingleTickerProviderStateMixin] to implement the necessary
/// [TickerProvider], creating its controller in the [initState] method and
/// disposing of it in the [dispose] method. The duration of the controller is
/// configured from a property in the [Foo] widget; as that changes, the
/// [didUpdateWidget] method is used to update the controller.
///
/// ```dart
/// class Foo extends StatefulWidget {
///   Foo({ Key key, this.duration }) : super(key: key);
///
///   final Duration duration;
///
///   @override
///   _FooState createState() => _FooState();
/// }
///
/// class _FooState extends State<Foo> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
///   AnimationController _controller;
///
///   @override
///   void initState() {
///     super.initState();
///     _controller = AnimationController(
///       vsync: this, // the SingleTickerProviderStateMixin
///       duration: widget.duration,
///     );
///   }
///
///   @override
///   void didUpdateWidget(Foo oldWidget) {
///     super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
///     _controller.duration = widget.duration;
///   }
///
///   @override
///   void dispose() {
///     _controller.dispose();
///     super.dispose();
///   }
///
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     return Container(); // ...
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
/// {@tool sample}
///
/// The following method (for a [State] subclass) drives two animation
/// controllers using Dart's asynchronous syntax for awaiting [Future] objects:
///
/// ```dart
/// Future<void> fadeOutAndUpdateState() async {
///   try {
///     await fadeAnimationController.forward().orCancel;
///     await sizeAnimationController.forward().orCancel;
///     setState(() {
///       dismissed = true;
///     });
///   } on TickerCanceled {
///     // the animation got canceled, probably because we were disposed
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// The assumption in the code above is that the animation controllers are being
/// disposed in the [State] subclass' override of the [State.dispose] method.
/// Since disposing the controller cancels the animation (raising a
/// [TickerCanceled] exception), the code here can skip verifying whether
/// [State.mounted] is still true at each step. (Again, this assumes that the
/// controllers are created in [State.initState] and disposed in
/// [State.dispose], as described in the previous section.)
