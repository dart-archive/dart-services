/// value of the animation might not change monotonically (e.g., if the
/// animation uses a curve that bounces).
///
/// Animations also let other objects listen for changes to either their value
/// or their status. These callbacks are called during the "animation" phase of
/// the pipeline, just prior to rebuilding widgets.
///
/// To create a new animation that you can run forward and backward, consider
/// using [AnimationController].

///    convert `Animation<double>`s into other kinds of `Animation`s.

  /// is `double`). This means, for instance, that it can be called on
  /// [AnimationController] objects, as well as [CurvedAnimation]s,
  /// [ProxyAnimation]s, [ReverseAnimation]s, [TrainHoppingAnimation]s, etc.
  ///
  /// It returns an [Animation] specialized to the same type, `U`, as the
  /// argument to the method (`child`), whose value is derived by applying the
  /// given [Tween] to the value of this [Animation].
  ///
  /// {@tool sample}
  ///
  /// Given an [AnimationController] `_controller`, the following code creates
  /// an `Animation<Alignment>` that swings from top left to top right as the
  /// controller goes from 0.0 to 1.0:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// Animation<Alignment> _alignment1 = _controller.drive(
  ///   AlignmentTween(
  ///     begin: Alignment.topLeft,
  ///     end: Alignment.topRight,
  ///   ),
  /// );
  /// ```
  /// {@end-tool}
  /// {@tool sample}
  ///
  /// The `_alignment.value` could then be used in a widget's build method, for
  /// instance, to position a child using an [Align] widget such that the
  /// position of the child shifts over time from the top left to the top right.
  ///
  /// It is common to ease this kind of curve, e.g. making the transition slower
  /// at the start and faster at the end. The following snippet shows one way to
  /// chain the alignment tween in the previous example to an easing curve (in
  /// this case, [Curves.easeIn]). In this example, the tween is created
  /// elsewhere as a variable that can be reused, since none of its arguments
  /// vary.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// final Animatable<Alignment> _tween = AlignmentTween(begin: Alignment.topLeft, end: Alignment.topRight)
  ///   .chain(CurveTween(curve: Curves.easeIn));
  /// // ...
  /// Animation<Alignment> _alignment2 = _controller.drive(_tween);
  /// ```
  /// {@end-tool}
  /// {@tool sample}
  ///
  /// The following code is exactly equivalent, and is typically clearer when
  /// the tweens are created inline, as might be preferred when the tweens have
  /// values that depend on other variables:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// Animation<Alignment> _alignment3 = _controller
  ///   .drive(CurveTween(curve: Curves.easeIn))
  ///   .drive(AlignmentTween(
  ///     begin: Alignment.topLeft,
  ///     end: Alignment.topRight,
  ///   ));
  /// ```
  /// {@end-tool}
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  ///  * [Animatable.animate], which does the same thing.
  ///  * [AnimationController], which is usually used to drive animations.
  ///  * [CurvedAnimation], an alternative to [CurveTween] for applying easing
  ///    curves, which supports distinct curves in the forward direction and the
  ///    reverse direction.
