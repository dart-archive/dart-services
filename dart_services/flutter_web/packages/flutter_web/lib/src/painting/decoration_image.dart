/// Paints an image into the given rectangle on the canvas.
///
/// The arguments have the following meanings:
///
///  * `canvas`: The canvas onto which the image will be painted.
///
///  * `rect`: The region of the canvas into which the image will be painted.
///    The image might not fill the entire rectangle (e.g., depending on the
///    `fit`). If `rect` is empty, nothing is painted.
///
///  * `image`: The image to paint onto the canvas.
///
///  * `scale`: The number of image pixels for each logical pixel.
///
///  * `colorFilter`: If non-null, the color filter to apply when painting the
///    image.
///
///  * `fit`: How the image should be inscribed into `rect`. If null, the
///    default behavior depends on `centerSlice`. If `centerSlice` is also null,
///    the default behavior is [BoxFit.scaleDown]. If `centerSlice` is
///    non-null, the default behavior is [BoxFit.fill]. See [BoxFit] for
///    details.
///
///  * `alignment`: How the destination rectangle defined by applying `fit` is
///    aligned within `rect`. For example, if `fit` is [BoxFit.contain] and
///    `alignment` is [Alignment.bottomRight], the image will be as large
///    as possible within `rect` and placed with its bottom right corner at the
///    bottom right corner of `rect`. Defaults to [Alignment.center].
///
///  * `centerSlice`: The image is drawn in nine portions described by splitting
///    the image by drawing two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, where
///    `centerSlice` describes the rectangle formed by the four points where
///    these four lines intersect each other. (This forms a 3-by-3 grid
///    of regions, the center region being described by `centerSlice`.)
///    The four regions in the corners are drawn, without scaling, in the four
///    corners of the destination rectangle defined by applying `fit`. The
///    remaining five regions are drawn by stretching them to fit such that they
///    exactly cover the destination rectangle while maintaining their relative
///    positions.
///
///  * `repeat`: If the image does not fill `rect`, whether and how the image
///    should be repeated to fill `rect`. By default, the image is not repeated.
///    See [ImageRepeat] for details.
///
///  * `flipHorizontally`: Whether to flip the image horizontally. This is
///    occasionally used with images in right-to-left environments, for images
///    that were designed for left-to-right locales (or vice versa). Be careful,
///    when using this, to not flip images with integral shadows, text, or other
///    effects that will look incorrect when flipped.
///
///  * `invertColors`: Inverting the colors of an image applies a new color
///    filter to the paint. If there is another specified color filter, the
///    invert will be applied after it. This is primarily used for implementing
///    smart invert on iOS.
///
///  * `filterQuality`: Use this to change the quality when scaling an image.
///     Use the [FilterQuality.low] quality setting to scale the image, which corresponds to
///     bilinear interpolation, rather than the default [FilterQuality.none] which corresponds
///     to nearest-neighbor.
///
/// The `canvas`, `rect`, `image`, `scale`, `alignment`, `repeat`, `flipHorizontally` and `filterQuality`
/// arguments must not be null.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [paintBorder], which paints a border around a rectangle on a canvas.
///  * [DecorationImage], which holds a configuration for calling this function.
///  * [BoxDecoration], which uses this function to paint a [DecorationImage].
