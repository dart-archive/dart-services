/// Fetches an image from an [AssetBundle], having determined the exact image to
/// use based on the context.
///
/// Given a main asset and a set of variants, AssetImage chooses the most
/// appropriate asset for the current context, based on the device pixel ratio
/// and size given in the configuration passed to [resolve].
///
/// To show a specific image from a bundle without any asset resolution, use an
/// [AssetBundleImageProvider].
///
/// ## Naming assets for matching with different pixel densities
///
/// Main assets are presumed to match a nominal pixel ratio of 1.0. To specify
/// assets targeting different pixel ratios, place the variant assets in
/// the application bundle under subdirectories named in the form "Nx", where
/// N is the nominal device pixel ratio for that asset.
///
/// For example, suppose an application wants to use an icon named
/// "heart.png". This icon has representations at 1.0 (the main icon), as well
/// as 1.5 and 2.0 pixel ratios (variants). The asset bundle should then contain
/// the following assets:
///
/// ```
/// heart.png
/// 1.5x/heart.png
/// 2.0x/heart.png
/// ```
///
/// On a device with a 1.0 device pixel ratio, the image chosen would be
/// heart.png; on a device with a 1.3 device pixel ratio, the image chosen
/// would be 1.5x/heart.png.
///
/// The directory level of the asset does not matter as long as the variants are
/// at the equivalent level; that is, the following is also a valid bundle
/// structure:
///
/// ```
/// icons/heart.png
/// icons/1.5x/heart.png
/// icons/2.0x/heart.png
/// ```
///
/// assets/icons/3.0x/heart.png would be a valid variant of
/// assets/icons/heart.png.
///
///
/// ## Fetching assets
///
/// When fetching an image provided by the app itself, use the [assetName]
/// argument to name the asset to choose. For instance, consider the structure
/// above. First, the `pubspec.yaml` of the project should specify its assets in
/// the `flutter` section:
///
/// ```yaml
/// flutter:
///   assets:
///     - icons/heart.png
/// ```
///
/// Then, to fetch the image, use
/// ```dart
/// AssetImage('icons/heart.png')
/// ```
///
/// ## Assets in packages
///
/// To fetch an asset from a package, the [package] argument must be provided.
/// For instance, suppose the structure above is inside a package called
/// `my_icons`. Then to fetch the image, use:
///
/// ```dart
/// AssetImage('icons/heart.png', package: 'my_icons')
/// ```
///
/// Assets used by the package itself should also be fetched using the [package]
/// argument as above.
///
/// If the desired asset is specified in the `pubspec.yaml` of the package, it
/// is bundled automatically with the app. In particular, assets used by the
/// package itself must be specified in its `pubspec.yaml`.
///
/// A package can also choose to have assets in its 'lib/' folder that are not
/// specified in its `pubspec.yaml`. In this case for those images to be
/// bundled, the app has to specify which ones to include. For instance a
/// package named `fancy_backgrounds` could have:
///
/// ```
/// lib/backgrounds/background1.png
/// lib/backgrounds/background2.png
/// lib/backgrounds/background3.png
///```
///
/// To include, say the first image, the `pubspec.yaml` of the app should specify
/// it in the `assets` section:
///
/// ```yaml
///  assets:
///    - packages/fancy_backgrounds/backgrounds/background1.png
/// ```
///
/// The `lib/` is implied, so it should not be included in the asset path.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Image.asset] for a shorthand of an [Image] widget backed by [AssetImage]
///    when used without a scale.
