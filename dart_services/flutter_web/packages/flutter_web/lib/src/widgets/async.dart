/// to a [FutureBuilder] will result in a single frame in the
/// [ConnectionState.waiting] state. This is because there is no way to
/// synchronously determine that a [Future] has already completed.
///
/// ## Builder contract
///
/// For a future that completes successfully with data, assuming [initialData]
/// is null, the [builder] will be called with either both or only the latter of
/// the following snapshots:
///
/// * `new AsyncSnapshot<String>.withData(ConnectionState.waiting, null)`
/// * `new AsyncSnapshot<String>.withData(ConnectionState.done, 'some data')`
///
/// If that same future instead completed with an error, the [builder] would be
/// called with either both or only the latter of:
///
/// * `new AsyncSnapshot<String>.withData(ConnectionState.waiting, null)`
/// * `new AsyncSnapshot<String>.withError(ConnectionState.done, 'some error')`
///
/// The initial snapshot data can be controlled by specifying [initialData]. You
/// would use this facility to ensure that if the [builder] is invoked before
/// the future completes, the snapshot carries data of your choice rather than
/// the default null value.
///
/// The data and error fields of the snapshot change only as the connection
/// state field transitions from `waiting` to `done`, and they will be retained
/// when changing the [FutureBuilder] configuration to another future. If the
/// old future has already completed successfully with data as above, changing
/// configuration to a new future results in snapshot pairs of the form:
///
/// * `new AsyncSnapshot<String>.withData(ConnectionState.none, 'data of first future')`
/// * `new AsyncSnapshot<String>.withData(ConnectionState.waiting, 'data of second future')`
///
/// In general, the latter will be produced only when the new future is
/// non-null, and the former only when the old future is non-null.
///
/// A [FutureBuilder] behaves identically to a [StreamBuilder] configured with
/// `future?.asStream()`, except that snapshots with `ConnectionState.active`
/// may appear for the latter, depending on how the stream is implemented.
