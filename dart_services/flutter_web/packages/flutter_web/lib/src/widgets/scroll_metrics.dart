/// This class defines a current position, [pixels], and a range of values
/// considered "in bounds" for that position. The range has a minimum value at
/// [minScrollExtent] and a maximum value at [maxScrollExtent] (inclusive). The
/// viewport scrolls in the direction and axis described by [axisDirection]
/// and [axis].
///
/// The [outOfRange] getter will return true if [pixels] is outside this defined
/// range. The [atEdge] getter will return true if the [pixels] position equals
/// either the [minScrollExtent] or the [maxScrollExtent].
///
/// The dimensions of the viewport in the given [axis] are described by
/// [viewportDimension].
///
/// The above values are also exposed in terms of [extentBefore],
/// [extentInside], and [extentAfter], which may be more useful for use cases
/// such as scroll bars; for example, see [Scrollbar].
