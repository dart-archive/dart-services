/// When a [PageRoute] is pushed or popped with the [Navigator], the entire
/// screen's content is replaced. An old route disappears and a new route
/// appears. If there's a common visual feature on both routes then it can
/// be helpful for orienting the user for the feature to physically move from
/// one page to the other during the routes' transition. Such an animation
/// is called a *hero animation*. The hero widgets "fly" in the Navigator's
/// overlay during the transition and while they're in-flight they're, by
/// default, not shown in their original locations in the old and new routes.
///
/// To label a widget as such a feature, wrap it in a [Hero] widget. When
/// navigation happens, the [Hero] widgets on each route are identified
/// by the [HeroController]. For each pair of [Hero] widgets that have the
/// same tag, a hero animation is triggered.
///
/// If a [Hero] is already in flight when navigation occurs, its
/// flight animation will be redirected to its new destination. The
/// widget shown in-flight during the transition is, by default, the
/// destination route's [Hero]'s child.

///
/// {@youtube 560 315 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be9UH1kXFDw}
///
/// ## Discussion
///
/// Heroes and the [Navigator]'s [Overlay] [Stack] must be axis-aligned for
/// all this to work. The top left and bottom right coordinates of each animated
/// Hero will be converted to global coordinates and then from there converted
/// to that [Stack]'s coordinate space, and the entire Hero subtree will, for
/// the duration of the animation, be lifted out of its original place, and
/// positioned on that stack. If the [Hero] isn't axis aligned, this is going to
/// fail in a rather ugly fashion. Don't rotate your heroes!
///
/// To make the animations look good, it's critical that the widget tree for the
/// hero in both locations be essentially identical. The widget of the *target*
/// is, by default, used to do the transition: when going from route A to route
/// B, route B's hero's widget is placed over route A's hero's widget. If a
/// [flightShuttleBuilder] is supplied, its output widget is shown during the
/// flight transition instead.
///
/// By default, both route A and route B's heroes are hidden while the
/// transitioning widget is animating in-flight above the 2 routes.
/// [placeholderBuilder] can be used to show a custom widget in their place
/// instead once the transition has taken flight.
///
/// During the transition, the transition widget is animated to route B's hero's
/// position, and then the widget is inserted into route B. When going back from
/// B to A, route A's hero's widget is, by default, placed over where route B's
/// hero's widget was, and then the animation goes the other way.
///
/// ### Nested Navigators
///
/// If either or both routes contain nested [Navigator]s, only [Hero]es
/// contained in the top-most routes (as defined by [Route.isCurrent]) *of those
/// nested [Navigator]s* are considered for animation. Just like in the
/// non-nested case the top-most routes containing these [Hero]es in the nested
/// [Navigator]s have to be [PageRoute]s.
