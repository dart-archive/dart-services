/// An image that shows a [placeholder] image while the target [image] is
/// loading, then fades in the new image when it loads.
///
/// Use this class to display long-loading images, such as [new NetworkImage],
/// so that the image appears on screen with a graceful animation rather than
/// abruptly pops onto the screen.
///
/// If the [image] emits an [ImageInfo] synchronously, such as when the image
/// has been loaded and cached, the [image] is displayed immediately and the
/// [placeholder] is never displayed.
///
/// [fadeOutDuration] and [fadeOutCurve] control the fade-out animation of the
/// placeholder.
///
/// [fadeInDuration] and [fadeInCurve] control the fade-in animation of the
/// target [image].
///
/// Prefer a [placeholder] that's already cached so that it is displayed in one
/// frame. This prevents it from popping onto the screen.
///
/// When [image] changes it is resolved to a new [ImageStream]. If the new
/// [ImageStream.key] is different this widget subscribes to the new stream and
/// replaces the displayed image with images emitted by the new stream.
///
/// When [placeholder] changes and the [image] has not yet emitted an
/// [ImageInfo], then [placeholder] is resolved to a new [ImageStream]. If the
/// new [ImageStream.key] is different this widget subscribes to the new stream
/// and replaces the displayed image to images emitted by the new stream.
///
/// When either [placeholder] or [image] changes, this widget continues showing
/// the previously loaded image (if any) until the new image provider provides a
/// different image. This is known as "gapless playback" (see also
/// [Image.gaplessPlayback]).
///
