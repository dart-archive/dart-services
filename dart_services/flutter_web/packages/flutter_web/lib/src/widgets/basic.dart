// PAINTING NODES

/// A widget that makes its child partially transparent.
///
/// This class paints its child into an intermediate buffer and then blends the
/// child back into the scene partially transparent.
///
/// For values of opacity other than 0.0 and 1.0, this class is relatively
/// expensive because it requires painting the child into an intermediate
/// buffer. For the value 0.0, the child is simply not painted at all. For the
/// value 1.0, the child is painted immediately without an intermediate buffer.
///
/// {@youtube 560 315 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hltevOHQBw}
///
/// {@tool sample}
///
/// This example shows some [Text] when the `_visible` member field is true, and
/// hides it when it is false:
///
/// ```dart
/// Opacity(
///   opacity: _visible ? 1.0 : 0.0,
///   child: const Text('Now you see me, now you don\'t!'),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// This is more efficient than adding and removing the child widget from the
/// tree on demand.
///
/// ## Performance considerations for opacity animation
///
/// Animating an [Opacity] widget directly causes the widget (and possibly its
/// subtree) to rebuild each frame, which is not very efficient. Consider using
/// an [AnimatedOpacity] instead.
///
/// ## Transparent image
///
/// If only a single [Image] or [Color] needs to be composited with an opacity
/// between 0.0 and 1.0, it's much faster to directly use them without [Opacity]
/// widgets.
///
/// For example, `Container(color: Color.fromRGBO(255, 0, 0, 0.5))` is much
/// faster than `Opacity(opacity: 0.5, child: Container(color: Colors.red))`.
///
/// {@tool sample}
///
/// The following example draws an [Image] with 0.5 opacity without using
/// [Opacity]:
///
/// ```dart
/// Image.network(
///   'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter/assets-for-api-docs/master/packages/diagrams/assets/blend_mode_destination.jpeg',
///   color: Color.fromRGBO(255, 255, 255, 0.5),
///   colorBlendMode: BlendMode.modulate
/// )
/// ```
///
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// Directly drawing an [Image] or [Color] with opacity is faster than using
/// [Opacity] on top of them because [Opacity] could apply the opacity to a
/// group of widgets and therefore a costly offscreen buffer will be used.
/// Drawing content into the offscreen buffer may also trigger render target
/// switches and such switching is particularly slow in older GPUs.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Visibility], which can hide a child more efficiently (albeit less
///    subtly, because it is either visible or hidden, rather than allowing
///    fractional opacity values).
///  * [ShaderMask], which can apply more elaborate effects to its child.
///  * [Transform], which applies an arbitrary transform to its child widget at
///    paint time.
///  * [AnimatedOpacity], which uses an animation internally to efficiently
///    animate opacity.
///  * [FadeTransition], which uses a provided animation to efficiently animate
///    opacity.
///  * [Image], which can directly provide a partially transparent image with
///    much less performance hit.

/// A widget that positions its children relative to the edges of its box.

/// This class is useful if you want to overlap several children in a simple
/// way, for example having some text and an image, overlaid with a gradient and
/// a button attached to the bottom.
///
/// Each child of a [Stack] widget is either _positioned_ or _non-positioned_.
/// Positioned children are those wrapped in a [Positioned] widget that has at
/// least one non-null property. The stack sizes itself to contain all the
/// non-positioned children, which are positioned according to [alignment]
/// (which defaults to the top-left corner in left-to-right environments and the
/// top-right corner in right-to-left environments). The positioned children are
/// then placed relative to the stack according to their top, right, bottom, and
/// left properties.
///
/// The stack paints its children in order with the first child being at the
/// bottom. If you want to change the order in which the children paint, you
/// can rebuild the stack with the children in the new order. If you reorder
/// the children in this way, consider giving the children non-null keys.
/// These keys will cause the framework to move the underlying objects for
/// the children to their new locations rather than recreate them at their
/// new location.
///
/// For more details about the stack layout algorithm, see [RenderStack].
///
/// If you want to lay a number of children out in a particular pattern, or if
/// you want to make a custom layout manager, you probably want to use
/// [CustomMultiChildLayout] instead. In particular, when using a [Stack] you
/// can't position children relative to their size or the stack's own size.
///

/// verbose.
///
/// To cause a child to expand to fill the available space in the [direction]
/// of this widget's main axis, wrap the child in an [Expanded] widget.

/// you have some widgets and want them to be able to scroll if there is

///
/// If you only have one child, then rather than using [Flex], [Row], or
/// [Column], consider using [Align] or [Center] to position the child.
///
/// ## Layout algorithm
///
/// _This section describes how a [Flex] is rendered by the framework._
/// _See [BoxConstraints] for an introduction to box layout models._
///
/// Layout for a [Flex] proceeds in six steps:
///
/// 1. Layout each child a null or zero flex factor (e.g., those that are not
///    [Expanded]) with unbounded main axis constraints and the incoming
///    cross axis constraints. If the [crossAxisAlignment] is
///    [CrossAxisAlignment.stretch], instead use tight cross axis constraints
///    that match the incoming max extent in the cross axis.
/// 2. Divide the remaining main axis space among the children with non-zero
///    flex factors (e.g., those that are [Expanded]) according to their flex
///    factor. For example, a child with a flex factor of 2.0 will receive twice
///    the amount of main axis space as a child with a flex factor of 1.0.
/// 3. Layout each of the remaining children with the same cross axis
///    constraints as in step 1, but instead of using unbounded main axis
///    constraints, use max axis constraints based on the amount of space
///    allocated in step 2. Children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are
///    [FlexFit.tight] are given tight constraints (i.e., forced to fill the
///    allocated space), and children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are
///    [FlexFit.loose] are given loose constraints (i.e., not forced to fill the
///    allocated space).

///
/// ### Why does my row have a yellow and black warning stripe?
///
/// If the non-flexible contents of the row (those that are not wrapped in
/// [Expanded] or [Flexible] widgets) are together wider than the row itself,
/// then the row is said to have overflowed. When a row overflows, the row does
/// not have any remaining space to share between its [Expanded] and [Flexible]
/// children. The row reports this by drawing a yellow and black striped
/// warning box on the edge that is overflowing. If there is room on the outside
/// of the row, the amount of overflow is printed in red lettering.
///
/// #### Story time
///
/// Suppose, for instance, that you had this code:
///
/// ```dart
/// Row(
///   children: <Widget>[
///     const FlutterLogo(),
///     const Text('Flutter\'s hot reload helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bug faster. Experience sub-second reload times, without losing state, on emulators, simulators, and hardware for iOS and Android.'),
///     const Icon(Icons.sentiment_very_satisfied),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
///
/// You will see this issue when you run the app:
///
/// ![A screenshot of the error using the Row widget](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/row_error.png)
///
/// The row first asks its first child, the [FlutterLogo], to lay out, at
/// whatever size the logo would like. The logo is friendly and happily decides
/// to be 24 pixels to a side. This leaves lots of room for the next child. The
/// row then asks that next child, the text, to lay out, at whatever size it
/// thinks is best.
///
/// At this point, the text, not knowing how wide is too wide, says "Ok, I will
/// be thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis wide.", and goes well beyond the space that the
/// row has available, not wrapping. The row responds, "That's not fair, now I
/// have no more room available for my other children!", and gets angry and
/// sprouts a yellow and black strip.
///
/// {@tool sample}
/// The fix is to wrap the second child in an [Expanded] widget, which tells the
/// row that the child should be given the remaining room:
///
/// ![A screenshot of the Row widget after applying the fix](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/row_fixed.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// Row(
///   children: <Widget>[
///     const FlutterLogo(),
///     const Expanded(
///       child: Text('Flutter\'s hot reload helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bug faster. Experience sub-second reload times, without losing state, on emulators, simulators, and hardware for iOS and Android.'),
///     ),
///     const Icon(Icons.sentiment_very_satisfied),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// Now, the row first asks the logo to lay out, and then asks the _icon_ to lay
/// out. The [Icon], like the logo, is happy to take on a reasonable size (also
/// 24 pixels, not coincidentally, since both [FlutterLogo] and [Icon] honor the
/// ambient [IconTheme]). This leaves some room left over, and now the row tells
/// the text exactly how wide to be: the exact width of the remaining space. The
/// text, now happy to comply to a reasonable request, wraps the text within
/// that width, and you end up with a paragraph split over several lines.
///
/// ## Layout algorithm
///
/// _This section describes how a [Row] is rendered by the framework._
/// _See [BoxConstraints] for an introduction to box layout models._
///
/// Layout for a [Row] proceeds in six steps:
///
/// 1. Layout each child a null or zero flex factor (e.g., those that are not
///    [Expanded]) with unbounded horizontal constraints and the incoming
///    vertical constraints. If the [crossAxisAlignment] is
///    [CrossAxisAlignment.stretch], instead use tight vertical constraints that
///    match the incoming max height.
/// 2. Divide the remaining horizontal space among the children with non-zero
///    flex factors (e.g., those that are [Expanded]) according to their flex
///    factor. For example, a child with a flex factor of 2.0 will receive twice
///    the amount of horizontal space as a child with a flex factor of 1.0.
/// 3. Layout each of the remaining children with the same vertical constraints
///    as in step 1, but instead of using unbounded horizontal constraints, use
///    horizontal constraints based on the amount of space allocated in step 2.
///    Children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are [FlexFit.tight] are
///    given tight constraints (i.e., forced to fill the allocated space), and
///    children with [Flexible.fit] properties that are [FlexFit.loose] are
///    given loose constraints (i.e., not forced to fill the allocated space).
/// 4. The height of the [Row] is the maximum height of the children (which will
///    always satisfy the incoming vertical constraints).
/// 5. The width of the [Row] is determined by the [mainAxisSize] property. If
///    the [mainAxisSize] property is [MainAxisSize.max], then the width of the
///    [Row] is the max width of the incoming constraints. If the [mainAxisSize]
///    property is [MainAxisSize.min], then the width of the [Row] is the sum
///    of widths of the children (subject to the incoming constraints).
/// 6. Determine the position for each child according to the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] and the [crossAxisAlignment]. For example, if the
///    [mainAxisAlignment] is [MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween], any horizontal
///    space that has not been allocated to children is divided evenly and
///    placed between the children.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Column], for a vertical equivalent.
///  * [Flex], if you don't know in advance if you want a horizontal or vertical
///    arrangement.

/// ## Troubleshooting
///
/// ### When the incoming vertical constraints are unbounded
///
/// When a [Column] has one or more [Expanded] or [Flexible] children, and is
/// placed in another [Column], or in a [ListView], or in some other context
/// that does not provide a maximum height constraint for the [Column], you will
/// get an exception at runtime saying that there are children with non-zero
/// flex but the vertical constraints are unbounded.
///
/// The problem, as described in the details that accompany that exception, is
/// that using [Flexible] or [Expanded] means that the remaining space after
/// laying out all the other children must be shared equally, but if the
/// incoming vertical constraints are unbounded, there is infinite remaining
/// space.
///
/// The key to solving this problem is usually to determine why the [Column] is
/// receiving unbounded vertical constraints.
///
/// One common reason for this to happen is that the [Column] has been placed in
/// another [Column] (without using [Expanded] or [Flexible] around the inner
/// nested [Column]). When a [Column] lays out its non-flex children (those that
/// have neither [Expanded] or [Flexible] around them), it gives them unbounded
/// constraints so that they can determine their own dimensions (passing
/// unbounded constraints usually signals to the child that it should
/// shrink-wrap its contents). The solution in this case is typically to just
/// wrap the inner column in an [Expanded] to indicate that it should take the
/// remaining space of the outer column, rather than being allowed to take any
/// amount of room it desires.
///
/// Another reason for this message to be displayed is nesting a [Column] inside
/// a [ListView] or other vertical scrollable. In that scenario, there really is
/// infinite vertical space (the whole point of a vertical scrolling list is to
/// allow infinite space vertically). In such scenarios, it is usually worth
/// examining why the inner [Column] should have an [Expanded] or [Flexible]
/// child: what size should the inner children really be? The solution in this
/// case is typically to remove the [Expanded] or [Flexible] widgets from around
/// the inner children.
///
/// For more discussion about constraints, see [BoxConstraints].
///
/// ### The yellow and black striped banner
///
/// When the contents of a [Column] exceed the amount of space available, the
/// [Column] overflows, and the contents are clipped. In debug mode, a yellow
/// and black striped bar is rendered at the overflowing edge to indicate the
/// problem, and a message is printed below the [Column] saying how much
/// overflow was detected.
///
/// The usual solution is to use a [ListView] rather than a [Column], to enable
/// the contents to scroll when vertical space is limited.
///
/// ## Layout algorithm
///
/// _This section describes how a [Column] is rendered by the framework._

///
/// This is useful since [RenderObject.paint] may be triggered even if its
/// associated [Widget] instances did not change or rebuild. A [RenderObject]
/// will repaint whenever any [RenderObject] that shares the same [Layer] is
/// marked as being dirty and needing paint (see [RenderObject.markNeedsPaint]),
/// such as when an ancestor scrolls or when an ancestor or descendant animates.
///
/// Containing [RenderObject.paint] to parts of the render subtree that are
/// actually visually changing using [RepaintBoundary] explicitly or implicitly
/// is therefore critical to minimizing redundant work and improving the app's
/// performance.
///
/// When a [RenderObject] is flagged as needing to paint via
/// [RenderObject.markNeedsPaint], the nearest ancestor [RenderObject] with
/// [RenderObject.isRepaintBoundary], up to possibly the root of the application,
/// is requested to repaint. That nearest ancestor's [RenderObject.paint] method
/// will cause _all_ of its descendant [RenderObject]s to repaint in the same
/// layer.
///
/// [RepaintBoundary] is therefore used, both while propagating the
/// `markNeedsPaint` flag up the render tree and while traversing down the
/// render tree via [RenderObject.paintChild], to strategically contain repaints
/// to the render subtree that visually changed for performance. This is done
/// because the [RepaintBoundary] widget creates a [RenderObject] that always
/// has a [Layer], decoupling ancestor render objects from the descendant
/// render objects.
///
/// [RepaintBoundary] has the further side-effect of possibly hinting to the
/// engine that it should further optimize animation performance if the render
/// subtree behind the [RepaintBoundary] is sufficiently complex and is static
/// while the surrounding tree changes frequently. In those cases, the engine
/// may choose to pay a one time cost of rasterizing and caching the pixel
/// values of the subtree for faster future GPU re-rendering speed.
///
/// Several framework widgets insert [RepaintBoundary] widgets to mark natural
/// separation points in applications. For instance, contents in Material Design
/// drawers typically don't change while the drawer opens and closes, so
/// repaints are automatically contained to regions inside or outside the drawer
