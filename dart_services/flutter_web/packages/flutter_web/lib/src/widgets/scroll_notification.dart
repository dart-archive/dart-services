/// A [Notification] related to scrolling.

/// [Scrollable] widgets notify their ancestors about scrolling-related changes.
/// The notifications have the following lifecycle:
///
///  * A [ScrollStartNotification], which indicates that the widget has started
///    scrolling.
///  * Zero or more [ScrollUpdateNotification]s, which indicate that the widget
///    has changed its scroll position, mixed with zero or more
///    [OverscrollNotification]s, which indicate that the widget has not changed
///    its scroll position because the change would have caused its scroll
///    position to go outside its scroll bounds.
///  * Interspersed with the [ScrollUpdateNotification]s and
///    [OverscrollNotification]s are zero or more [UserScrollNotification]s,
///    which indicate that the user has changed the direction in which they are
///    scrolling.
///  * A [ScrollEndNotification], which indicates that the widget has stopped
///    scrolling.
///  * A [UserScrollNotification], with a [UserScrollNotification.direction] of
///    [ScrollDirection.idle].
///
/// Notifications bubble up through the tree, which means a given
/// [NotificationListener] will receive notifications for all descendant
/// [Scrollable] widgets. To focus on notifications from the nearest
/// [Scrollable] descendant, check that the [depth] property of the notification
/// is zero.
///
/// When a scroll notification is received by a [NotificationListener], the
/// listener will have already completed build and layout, and it is therefore
/// too late for that widget to call [State.setState]. Any attempt to adjust the
/// build or layout based on a scroll notification would result in a layout that
/// lagged one frame behind, which is a poor user experience. Scroll
/// notifications are therefore primarily useful for paint effects (since paint
/// happens after layout). The [GlowingOverscrollIndicator] and [Scrollbar]
/// widgets are examples of paint effects that use scroll notifications.
///
/// To drive layout based on the scroll position, consider listening to the
/// [ScrollPosition] directly (or indirectly via a [ScrollController]).
