/// An [InheritedWidget] that's intended to be used as the base class for
/// models whose dependents may only depend on one part or "aspect" of the
/// overall model.
///
/// An inherited widget's dependents are unconditionally rebuilt when the
/// inherited widget changes per [InheritedWidget.updateShouldNotify].
/// This widget is similar except that dependents aren't rebuilt
/// unconditionally.
///
/// Widgets that depend on an [InheritedModel] qualify their dependence
/// with a value that indicates what "aspect" of the model they depend
/// on. When the model is rebuilt, dependents will also be rebuilt, but
/// only if there was a change in the model that corresponds to the aspect
/// they provided.
///
/// The type parameter `T` is the type of the model aspect objects.
///
/// Widgets create a dependency on an [InheritedModel] with a static method:
/// [InheritedModel.inheritFrom]. This method's `context` parameter
/// defines the subtree that will be rebuilt when the model changes.
/// Typically the `inheritFrom` method is called from a model-specific
/// static `of` method. For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyModel extends InheritedModel<String> {
///   // ...
///   static MyModel of(BuildContext context, String aspect) {
///     return InheritedModel.inheritFrom<MyModel>(context, aspect: aspect);
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Calling `MyModel.of(context, 'foo')` means that `context` should only
/// be rebuilt when the `foo` aspect of `MyModel` changes. If the aspect
/// is null, then the model supports all aspects.
///
/// When the inherited model is rebuilt the [updateShouldNotify] and
/// [updateShouldNotifyDependent] methods are used to decide what
/// should be rebuilt. If [updateShouldNotify] returns true, then the
/// inherited model's [updateShouldNotifyDependent] method is tested for
/// each dependent and the set of aspect objects it depends on.
/// The [updateShouldNotifyDependent] method must compare the set of aspect
/// dependencies with the changes in the model itself.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// class ABModel extends InheritedModel<String> {
///   ABModel({ this.a, this.b, Widget child }) : super(child: child);
///
///   final int a;
///   final int b;
///
///   @override
///   bool updateShouldNotify(ABModel old) {
///     return a != old.a || b != old.b;
///   }
///
///   @override
///   bool updateShouldNotifyDependent(ABModel old, Set<String> aspects) {
///     return (a != old.a && aspects.contains('a'))
///         || (b != old.b && aspects.contains('b'))
///   }
///
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the previous example the dependencies checked by
/// [updateShouldNotifyDependent] are just the aspect strings passed to
/// `inheritFromWidgetOfExactType`. They're represented as a [Set] because
/// one Widget can depend on more than one aspect of the model.
/// If a widget depends on the model but doesn't specify an aspect,
/// then changes in the model will cause the widget to be rebuilt
/// unconditionally.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [InheritedWidget], an inherited widget that only notifies dependents
///    when its value is different.
///  * [InheritedNotifier], an inherited widget whose value can be a
///    [Listenable], and which will notify dependents whenever the value
///    sends notifications.
