/// Whether to show or hide a child.
///
/// By default, the [visible] property controls whether the [child] is included
/// in the subtree or not; when it is not [visible], the [replacement] child
/// (typically a zero-sized box) is included instead.
///
/// A variety of flags can be used to tweak exactly how the child is hidden.
/// (Changing the flags dynamically is discouraged, as it can cause the [child]
/// subtree to be rebuilt, with any state in the subtree being discarded.
/// Typically, only the [visible] flag is changed dynamically.)
///
/// These widgets provide some of the facets of this one:
///
///  * [Opacity], which can stop its child from being painted.
///  * [Offstage], which can stop its child from being laid out or painted.
///  * [TickerMode], which can stop its child from being animated.
///  * [ExcludeSemantics], which can hide the child from accessibility tools.
///  * [IgnorePointer], which can disable touch interactions with the child.
///
/// Using this widget is not necessary to hide children. The simplest way to
/// hide a child is just to not include it, or, if a child _must_ be given (e.g.
/// because the parent is a [StatelessWidget]) then to use [SizedBox.shrink]
/// instead of the child that would otherwise be included.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [AnimatedSwitcher], which can fade from one child to the next as the
///    subtree changes.
///  * [AnimatedCrossFade], which can fade between two specific children.
