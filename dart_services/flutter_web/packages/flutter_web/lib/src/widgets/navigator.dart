/// A widget that manages a set of child widgets with a stack discipline.
///
/// Many apps have a navigator near the top of their widget hierarchy in order
/// to display their logical history using an [Overlay] with the most recently
/// visited pages visually on top of the older pages. Using this pattern lets
/// the navigator visually transition from one page to another by moving the widgets
/// around in the overlay. Similarly, the navigator can be used to show a dialog
/// by positioning the dialog widget above the current page.
///
/// ## Using the Navigator
///
/// Mobile apps typically reveal their contents via full-screen elements
/// called "screens" or "pages". In Flutter these elements are called
/// routes and they're managed by a [Navigator] widget. The navigator
/// manages a stack of [Route] objects and provides methods for managing
/// the stack, like [Navigator.push] and [Navigator.pop].
///
/// ### Displaying a full-screen route
///
/// Although you can create a navigator directly, it's most common to use
/// the navigator created by a [WidgetsApp] or a [MaterialApp] widget. You
/// can refer to that navigator with [Navigator.of].
///
/// A [MaterialApp] is the simplest way to set things up. The [MaterialApp]'s
/// home becomes the route at the bottom of the [Navigator]'s stack. It is what
/// you see when the app is launched.
///
/// ```dart
/// void main() {
///   runApp(MaterialApp(home: MyAppHome()));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To push a new route on the stack you can create an instance of
/// [MaterialPageRoute] with a builder function that creates whatever you
/// want to appear on the screen. For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute<void>(
///   builder: (BuildContext context) {
///     return Scaffold(
///       appBar: AppBar(title: Text('My Page')),
///       body: Center(
///         child: FlatButton(
///           child: Text('POP'),
///           onPressed: () {
///             Navigator.pop(context);
///           },
///         ),
///       ),
///     );
///   },
/// ));
/// ```
///
/// The route defines its widget with a builder function instead of a
/// child widget because it will be built and rebuilt in different
/// contexts depending on when it's pushed and popped.
///
/// As you can see, the new route can be popped, revealing the app's home
/// page, with the Navigator's pop method:
///
/// ```dart
/// Navigator.pop(context);
/// ```
///
/// It usually isn't necessary to provide a widget that pops the Navigator
/// in a route with a [Scaffold] because the Scaffold automatically adds a
/// 'back' button to its AppBar. Pressing the back button causes
/// [Navigator.pop] to be called. On Android, pressing the system back
/// button does the same thing.
///
/// ### Using named navigator routes
///
/// Mobile apps often manage a large number of routes and it's often
/// easiest to refer to them by name. Route names, by convention,
/// use a path-like structure (for example, '/a/b/c').
/// The app's home page route is named '/' by default.
///
/// The [MaterialApp] can be created
/// with a [Map<String, WidgetBuilder>] which maps from a route's name to
/// a builder function that will create it. The [MaterialApp] uses this
/// map to create a value for its navigator's [onGenerateRoute] callback.
///
/// ```dart
/// void main() {
///   runApp(MaterialApp(
///     home: MyAppHome(), // becomes the route named '/'
///     routes: <String, WidgetBuilder> {
///       '/a': (BuildContext context) => MyPage(title: 'page A'),
///       '/b': (BuildContext context) => MyPage(title: 'page B'),
///       '/c': (BuildContext context) => MyPage(title: 'page C'),
///     },
///   ));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To show a route by name:
///
/// ```dart
/// Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/b');
/// ```
///
/// ### Routes can return a value
///
/// When a route is pushed to ask the user for a value, the value can be
/// returned via the [pop] method's result parameter.
///
/// Methods that push a route return a [Future]. The Future resolves when the
/// route is popped and the [Future]'s value is the [pop] method's `result`
/// parameter.
///
/// For example if we wanted to ask the user to press 'OK' to confirm an
/// operation we could `await` the result of [Navigator.push]:
///
/// ```dart
/// bool value = await Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute<bool>(
///   builder: (BuildContext context) {
///     return Center(
///       child: GestureDetector(
///         child: Text('OK'),
///         onTap: () { Navigator.pop(context, true); }
///       ),
///     );
///   }
/// ));
/// ```
///
/// If the user presses 'OK' then value will be true. If the user backs
/// out of the route, for example by pressing the Scaffold's back button,
/// the value will be null.
///
/// When a route is used to return a value, the route's type parameter must
/// match the type of [pop]'s result. That's why we've used
/// `MaterialPageRoute<bool>` instead of `MaterialPageRoute<void>` or just
/// `MaterialPageRoute`. (If you prefer to not specify the types, though, that's
/// fine too.)
///
/// ### Popup routes
///
/// Routes don't have to obscure the entire screen. [PopupRoute]s cover the
/// screen with a [ModalRoute.barrierColor] that can be only partially opaque to
/// allow the current screen to show through. Popup routes are "modal" because
/// they block input to the widgets below.
///
/// There are functions which create and show popup routes. For
/// example: [showDialog], [showMenu], and [showModalBottomSheet]. These
/// functions return their pushed route's Future as described above.
/// Callers can await the returned value to take an action when the
/// route is popped, or to discover the route's value.
///
/// There are also widgets which create popup routes, like [PopupMenuButton] and
/// [DropdownButton]. These widgets create internal subclasses of PopupRoute
/// and use the Navigator's push and pop methods to show and dismiss them.
///
/// ### Custom routes
///
/// You can create your own subclass of one of the widget library route classes
/// like [PopupRoute], [ModalRoute], or [PageRoute], to control the animated
/// transition employed to show the route, the color and behavior of the route's
/// modal barrier, and other aspects of the route.
///
/// The [PageRouteBuilder] class makes it possible to define a custom route
/// in terms of callbacks. Here's an example that rotates and fades its child
/// when the route appears or disappears. This route does not obscure the entire
/// screen because it specifies `opaque: false`, just as a popup route does.
///
/// ```dart
/// Navigator.push(context, PageRouteBuilder(
///   opaque: false,
///   pageBuilder: (BuildContext context, _, __) {
///     return Center(child: Text('My PageRoute'));
///   },
///   transitionsBuilder: (___, Animation<double> animation, ____, Widget child) {
///     return FadeTransition(
///       opacity: animation,
///       child: RotationTransition(
///         turns: Tween<double>(begin: 0.5, end: 1.0).animate(animation),
///         child: child,
///       ),
///     );
///   }
/// ));
/// ```
///
/// The page route is built in two parts, the "page" and the
/// "transitions". The page becomes a descendant of the child passed to
/// the `transitionsBuilder` function. Typically the page is only built once,
/// because it doesn't depend on its animation parameters (elided with `_`
/// and `__` in this example). The transition is built on every frame
/// for its duration.
///
/// ### Nesting Navigators
///
/// An app can use more than one Navigator. Nesting one Navigator below
/// another Navigator can be used to create an "inner journey" such as tabbed
/// navigation, user registration, store checkout, or other independent journeys
/// that represent a subsection of your overall application.
///
/// #### Real World Example
///
/// It is standard practice for iOS apps to use tabbed navigation where each
/// tab maintains its own navigation history. Therefore, each tab has its own
/// [Navigator], creating a kind of "parallel navigation."
///
/// In addition to the parallel navigation of the tabs, it is still possible to
/// launch full-screen pages that completely cover the tabs. For example: an
/// on-boarding flow, or an alert dialog. Therefore, there must exist a "root"
/// [Navigator] that sits above the tab navigation. As a result, each of the
/// tab's [Navigator]s are actually nested [Navigator]s sitting below a single
/// root [Navigator].
///
/// The nested [Navigator]s for tabbed navigation sit in [WidgetApp] and
/// [CupertinoTabView], so you don't need to worry about nested [Navigator]s
/// in this situation, but it's a real world example where nested [Navigator]s
/// are used.
///
/// {@tool snippet --template=freeform}
/// The following example demonstrates how a nested [Navigator] can be used to
/// present a standalone user registration journey.
///
/// Even though this example uses two [Navigator]s to demonstrate nested
/// [Navigator]s, a similar result is possible using only a single [Navigator].
///
/// Run this example with `flutter run --route=/signup` to start it with
/// the signup flow instead of on the home page.
///
/// ```dart imports
/// import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
/// ```
///
/// ```dart main
/// void main() => runApp(new MyApp());
/// ```
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
