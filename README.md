## What is it? What does it do?

This project is a small, stateless Dart server, which exposes a RESTful API.
The API provides services to:

- compile Dart code
- analyze Dart code (for errors and warnings)
- perform code completion for a snippet of Dart code
- get dartdoc tooltip information for a snippet of Dart code
- format Dart code
- get quick fixes for problems in code

## Project status

It is currently in a pre-alpha state, partially complete, and very much under active development.

## Try it

A simple DartPad example of how to use the library is here:
https://dartpad.dartlang.org/2a7fd9328e0a567ee79b

## The API

The discovery doc for the server's REST API is available here:
http://dart-services.appspot.com/api/discovery/v1/apis/dartservices/v1/rest.

## Running

To run the server, run:

    dart bin/services.dart --port 8082

The server will run from port 8082 and export several JSON APIs, like
`/api/compile` and `/api/analyze`.
