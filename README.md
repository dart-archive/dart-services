## What is it? What does it do?

This project is a small, stateless Dart server, which exposes a RESTful API.
The API provides services to:

- analyze Dart code for errors and warnings (`/api/dartservices/v1/analyze`)
- compile Dart code (`/api/dartservices/v1/compile`)
- perform code completion for a snippet of Dart code (`/api/dartservices/v1/complete`)
- get dartdoc tooltip information for a snippet of Dart code (`/api/dartservices/v1/document`)
- format Dart code (`/api/dartservices/v1/format`)
- get quick fixes for problems in code (`/api/dartservices/v1/fixes`)

## Try it!

A simple DartPad example of how to use the library is here:

## Project status

The services APIs are running and available to use. Please give it a try! We may
still amend them from time to time in a way that causes breaking changes. If you
would like to make sure we discuss this with you first, please get in touch to
let us know.

## The API

The discovery doc for the server's REST API is available here:
http://dart-services.appspot.com/api/discovery/v1/apis/dartservices/v1/rest.

## Running

To run the server, run:

    dart bin/services.dart --port 8082

The server will run from port 8082 and export several JSON APIs, like
`/api/compile` and `/api/analyze`.

## Deploying

To deploy the server to Dart on AppEngine, follow the instructions [here](https://www.dartlang.org/server/google-cloud-platform/app-engine/).

Modify `warmup.dart` to point the BASE_URI to your AppEngine project.

Then run

    ./tools/deploy.sh

The will deploy the server, and run the warmup sequence and sanity checks.
