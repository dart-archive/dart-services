# The channel or version of the Flutter SDK to use.

# Note: either the 'channel' field or the 'version' field should be provided
# below, but not both. If neither a channel nor version is provided then no
# particular git configuration will be done to the Flutter SDK in `flutter-sdk/`
# (apart from any initial git clone).

# The dart-services server will automatically create or configure the
# flutter-sdk/ directory based on this configuration file at startup.

# In order to update the SDK manually, run 'dart tool/update_sdk.dart'.
